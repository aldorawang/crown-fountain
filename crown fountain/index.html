		<h1>Crown Fountain</h1>
		<h2>"A fountain is the memory of nature, this marvelous sound of a little river in the mountains translated to the city. For me, a fountain doesn't mean a big jet of water. It means humidity, the origin of life."</h2>

		<p>Crown Fountain is a piece of interactive public artwork by Jaume Plensa and executed by Krueck and Sexton Architects. It is located in Millennium Park, which is a park in Chicago, Illinois. It is also considered as a video sculpture. It is a significant piece of the city's world-renowned public art collection and adds more color to the beautiful city: Chicago.</p>
		<p>Jaume Plensa is a Spanish artist and sculptor, who was born in 1955 in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. He went to Llotja School and Escola Superior de Belles Arts de Sant Jordi. Plensa is known for his artwork Crown Fountain. Krueck and Sexton Architects, located in Chicago, Illinois, is an architecture practice. It was founded by Ron Krueck and Mark Sexton in 1979. The Millennium Park opened in July, 2004, and it was intended made for celebrating the third millennium.</p>
		<p>The Crown Fountain was also unveiled in July, 2004. The Crown Fountain includes a reflecting pool and two glass brick towers with LED screens. The two screens are each about 50 feet high, 23 feet wide, and 16 feet deep. The LED screen is used to display digital videos and images from Chicago citizens. About every fifteen minutes, the video pauses and takes a break. The screens are used to display different faces of 1,000 citizens of Chicago, and the screens are sculptured with two opened mouths to let water flow out. The water comes out from the two nozzles on the towers, and it looks like the face on the screen is spouting. The two towers face each other, and the water fountain is between the two screens. The water pool is made of black granite to give a reflecting illusion of the pool. People can take some time and walk on the pool and observe themselves from the pool's reflection. The water is filtered and recycled from the pool itself. The construction of the fountain cost around 17 millions.</p>
		<p>The inspiration for the piece is the people of Chicago. And the Crown Fountain, as mentioned before, is a meaningful interactive video sculpture. As Public Delivery says, "One of the most impressive features of the Crown Fountain is the power it gives back to humanity." The viewers like to walk on the water and play with the fountain. The waterfalls from the brick towers always attract much attention. The tourists also want to interact with two LED screens. During the night, the LED displays nature images or solid colors. People like to silhouetting themselves in front of the screen lighting during the time. The goal of Plensa was to make interactive and socially interacted artwork for the twenty-first century. Water is a significant component of the work because Chicago is a coastal city, and water plays a vital role in the city. The artist wanted to pursue a connection with nature.</p>
		<h2>"It's a piece of sculpture, it's a piece of art, it's a piece of architecture, it's a fountain," says Mark Sexton, the principal at Krueck & Sexton Architects, Chicago, "The biggest joy is the way everyone who has seen it has embraced it."</h2>
